Activity - user_id,session_id,activity_date,activity_type

Write a solution to find the daily active user count for a *period of 30 days ending 2019-07-27 inclusively*. A user was active on someday if they made at least one activity on that day.

select activity_date as day, count(distinct(user_id)) as active_users
FROM Activity 
WHERE activity_date BETWEEN DATEADD(dd,-29,'2019-07-27' ) AND '2019-07-27'
GROUP BY activity_date
HAVING count(distinct(user_id)) > 0

Since the end-date is included, DATEADD(-29) is used
