Q1) https://leetcode.com/problems/average-time-of-process-per-machine

A) Concept tested - JOIN
Aim: Find the average run time of each machine where the start and end timestamp is given separately

SOLUTION:
Select machine_id, 
ROUND
(
	(SELECT avg(timestamp) from Activities a1 Where a1.machine_id = a.machine_id and a1.activity='end') -
	(SELECT avg(timestamp) from Activities a1 Where a1.machine_id = a.machine_id and a1.activity='start'), 3
) as processed_time
FROM Activities a
Group by machine_id
