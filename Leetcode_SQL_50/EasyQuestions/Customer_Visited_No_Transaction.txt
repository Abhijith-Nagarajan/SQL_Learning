Achieved using:
Select 'AS REQUIRED'
FROM T1
LEFT JOIN T2
ON T1.key = T2.key
WHERE T2.key is null

SOLUTION:

Select customer_id, count(customer_id) as count_no_trans
FROM Visits v
WHERE v.visit_id in 
(Select v.visit_id 
    FROM Visits v
    LEFT JOIN Transactions t
    ON t.visit_id = v.visit_id
    WHERE t.visit_id is null)
group by customer_id
