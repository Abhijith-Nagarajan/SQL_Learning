Q1) Given a table containing the candidate_id and skill as the data, return those candidate_id values who were skilled at Python, Tableau and PostgreSQL

A1) Initial idea: 

SELECT DISTINCT(candidate_id)
from candidates
where skill in ('Python','Tableau','PostgreSQL')
group by candidate_id
order by candidate_id;

This doesn't work as 'IN' returns rows by applying the 'OR' operation

Therefore, Other ideas:
a) Check for the candidate id in the where clause and apply 3 checks
b) Count the number of skills and check whether its 3

Approach (a)
SELECT DISTINCT(candidate_id)
FROM candidates
where candidate_id in (select candidate_id from candidates where skill = 'Python') AND
      candidate_id in (select candidate_id from candidates where skill = 'Tableau') AND
      candidate_id in (select candidate_id from candidates where skill = 'PostgreSQL') 
group by candidate_id
order by candidate_id;

Approach (b) 
SELECT DISTINCT(candidate_id)
FROM candidates
Where skill in ('Python','Tableau','PostgreSQL')
grouo by candidate_id
having count(skill)=3
order by candidate_id
