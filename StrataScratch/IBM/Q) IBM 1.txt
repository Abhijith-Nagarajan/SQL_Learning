With dept_salary_cte AS(
    SELECT employee_id, department,
    PERCENT_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary) AS PercentileSalary
    FROM employee_salaries
)

--select * from dept_salary_cte Where PercentileSalary >= 0.9

Select es.employee_id, es.salary, es.department 
FROM employee_salaries es
INNER JOIN dept_salary_cte cte
ON es.employee_id = cte.employee_id AND es.department = cte.department
WHERE 
es.employee_id IN 
(Select employee_id FROM employee_salaries where tenure >=3) AND
es.department IN 
(Select department FROM employee_salaries Group By department having count(employee_id)>=5) AND 
cte.PercentileSalary >= 0.9
