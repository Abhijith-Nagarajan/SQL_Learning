Q) Number of Comments Per User in 30 days before 2020-02-10

A) Select user_id, sum(number_of_comments) as total_comments
FROM fb_comments_count
Where number_of_comments > 0 AND 
CAST(created_at as date) between DATEADD(day, -30, '2020-02-10') AND '2020-02-10' 
Group by user_id
Order by total_comments DESC

Learning:
1) Whenever a date interval is asked, use the DATEADD() so that it can dynamically get the required dates instead of hard coding.
2) EXTRACT() does not work all the time.
So use CAST() instead
